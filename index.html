    <h4>Workshop Introduction</h4>

    <p>
    This is the official website of the 3rd International Workshop on Autonomous Agents for Social Good (AASG) 2022, which is co-located with <a target="_blank" href="https://aamas2022-conference.auckland.ac.nz/">AAMAS 2022</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    	This workshop aims to highlight the role of multi-agent systems (MAS) in social challenges. The goal of this workshop is to identify new MAS problems in the social domain, develop novel MAS solutions to resolve social challenges, and learn from the real-world deployment of MAS solutions in societies. This workshop expects to broaden the focus of MAS in social challenges and increase the diversity of MAS research.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are working on inviting NGOs (non-government organizations) from New Zealand and other countries to share the social challenges faced by different parts of the world. We believe the engagement with practitioners and stakeholders is the best way to push research in social good forward. This workshop aims to provide an opportunity for MAS researchers to exchange ideas and solutions with NGOs to tackle social challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some social challenges of interests include but not limited to: public health, conservation, and human right. Please see <a href='call'>call for papers</a> for more details.
