        </p>

    <h4>Detailed Information</h4>
        <p>We solicit papers in two categories (either work-in-progress or published works with interesting novelty):</p>  
        <p>    1. <strong>Research papers</strong> describing novel contributions in resolving social challenges using multi-agent systems. Both work in progress and recently published work will be considered. Submissions describing recently published work should clearly indicate the earlier venue and provide a link to the published paper. Papers in this category should be at most <strong>8 pages</strong>, with any number of additional pages containing bibliographic references only.</p>  
        <p>    2. <strong>Position papers</strong> describing open problems or neglected perspectives on the field, proposing ideas for bringing MAS methods into a new application area, or summarizing the focus areas of a group working on MAS for social good. Papers in this category should be at most <strong>4 pages</strong>, with any number of additional pages containing bibliographic references only.</p>  

        <p>This workshop has no archival proceedings, and the accepted papers are allowed to be submitted to other conference venues. Accepted submissions will have the option of being posted online on the workshop website. For authors who do not wish their papers to be posted online, please mention this in the workshop submission or inform the organizers. Accepted papers will be presented either as a research talk or a poster. The submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity of writing. We also welcome papers accepted at other venues to present their works in our workshop to facilitate more discussions. </p>  
    </p>

    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <p>
    This workshop focuses on the role of multi-agent systems in social challenges and how MAS solutions can benefit societies. For example, what role can MAS play in tackling the challenges in environmental sustainability? How can MAS techniques be used to determine public health policy? What actions can MAS research suggest to promote social justice? To bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners, this workshop provides a platform to exchange information between MAS researchers and practitioners who work on real-world challenges. We expect to invite speakers from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and practitioners to share their experiences in social challenges, followed by a panel discussion and poster section to exchange ideas. The goal is to understand the current state of research in MAS and the practice in social challenges, encouraging more collaboration between researchers and stakeholders of social challenges. The workshop will feature a mix of invited talks, panel discussions, research talks, and poster sessions. This workshop welcomes submissions spanning the full range of theoretical and applied works in MAS and social challenges.
    </p>

    <h4>Multi-agent Systems</h4>

    2. Multi-agent system solutions for social challenges, including algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, optimization, machine learning, and reinforcement learning, etc.</br>
    3. Real-world deployment of MAS solutions in various applications in social good.</br>
    </p>
